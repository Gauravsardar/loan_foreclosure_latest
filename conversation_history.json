Reasoning: The user is asking for personal information related to their loan account (\"my loan details\"). This directly aligns with the definition of the `user_data` category, which covers questions about personal account details. The semantic similarity scores also indicate the highest relevance to `user_data` (0.525). The predicted category label is not mapped, so the validation relies on the query and scores.\n2.
