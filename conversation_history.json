Can I request EMI waiver while foreclosing?\nRarely approved, but can be considered under hardship or negotiation cases.\n43. Can I foreclose one of multiple loans only?\nYes, each loan account is independent and can be foreclosed separately.\n44. Can I foreclose without penalty if I pay from my salary?\nForeclosure fee exemptions are not tied to income source unless specified under a corporate or\ngovernment scheme.\n45.

The user is asking for the penalty amount for loan foreclosure. Calculating a foreclosure penalty requires applying bank policy (rules for calculating penalties) to specific user loan data (outstanding principal, loan type, date, etc.). This involves multiple types: policy, user data, and calculation. The `combined` category is defined as involving multiple types, especially eligibility queries, but the definition also covers questions involving multiple types in general. The semantic similarity scores also show the highest score for `combined` (0.545), followed by `policy` (0.496) and `calculation` (0.308). While the core request is a calculation, the dependence on policy and user data makes it a `combined` query.\n2. Agent type: combined",
